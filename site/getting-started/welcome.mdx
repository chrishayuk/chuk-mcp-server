# Welcome to ChukMCPServer

ChukMCPServer is a **high-performance MCP (Model Context Protocol) server framework** for Python, designed for production-grade applications and seamless Claude Desktop integration.

## Why ChukMCPServer?

```python
from chuk_mcp_server import tool, run

@tool
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers together."""
    return a + b

run()  # Production-ready server in 5 lines!
```

<Card title="⚡ Performance First" icon="bolt">
  **Sub-3ms latency** per tool call with **36,000+ RPS** peak throughput. When LLMs issue dozens of tool calls per completion, every millisecond counts.
</Card>

<Card title="🚀 Zero Configuration" icon="rocket">
  Auto-detects optimal settings for your environment - local development, Docker, AWS, GCP, Azure, or edge platforms.
</Card>

<Card title="🔐 Built-in OAuth 2.1" icon="shield-check">
  Production-ready OAuth support for LinkedIn, GitHub, and custom providers. Build authenticated integrations in minutes.
</Card>

<Card title="🔗 Server Composition" icon="puzzle-piece">
  Compose multiple MCP servers into a unified endpoint through configuration. No code required.
</Card>

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI assistants like Claude to securely connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as USB for AI - a universal way to plug any tool into any AI assistant.

## Beyond Basic MCP

While MCP provides the protocol, ChukMCPServer adds:

- **Performance optimization** - <3ms overhead vs 5-50ms in typical implementations
- **Production features** - OAuth, rate limiting, health checks, metrics
- **Developer experience** - Zero config, auto-detection, FastAPI-like decorators
- **Deployment flexibility** - STDIO, HTTP, SSE, Docker, cloud platforms
- **Server composition** - Aggregate multiple servers with configuration
