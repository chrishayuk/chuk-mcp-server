# Bandit configuration for ChukMCPServer
# This file configures security scanning to handle legitimate cloud deployment patterns

# B104: hardcoded_bind_all_interfaces
# Justification: Cloud platforms (AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Run, Azure Functions, Vercel, etc.)
# require binding to 0.0.0.0 to accept traffic from the platform's load balancer.
# This is a standard and secure practice for containerized and serverless deployments.

# B608: hardcoded_sql_expressions
# Justification: False positive on README.md template string in cli.py scaffolder.
# The flagged f-string contains JSON examples and markdown formatting, not SQL.
# This is a documentation template, not a SQL query.
